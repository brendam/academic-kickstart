Last week I went to Auckland for [Kiwi Pycon 2013](http://nz.pycon.org/). I arrived a couple of days early and did some sightseeing with [Angus](http://projectgus.com/), including a visit to [Tangleball](http://tumblr.tangleball.org.nz/) hackerspace in Auckland

Had an enjoyable start to the conference at the tutorial sessions on Friday. In the morning I went to _Let's learn twisted_ run by Aurynn Shaw and then in the afternoon I helped out at _Introduction to Data Processing with Python_ run by Angus Gratton.

As I found at [PyconAU 2013](/talk/pyconau-2013-hobart/), the quality of the talks over the weekend was great. They were all recorded and are being published here:

* [Kiwi PyCon 2013 videos](https://pyvideo.org/events/kiwi-pycon-2013.html)
* on the conference website [list of talks and links to the videos and slides](http://nz.pycon.org/events/talks/)

Based on feedback about my pyconau talk, I redeveloped a similar talk for Kiwi PyCon. At the end of the talk, I didn't repeat peoples questions so they haven't been included in the video.

The slides and the IPython notebooks I used are available on GitHub - https://github.com/brendam/pyconnz2013talk. I'm interested in any feedback people have about the talk or about my workflow.
