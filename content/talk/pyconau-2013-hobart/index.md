Last week I had a fantastic time at Pyconau 2013 in Hobart. The videos of the talks are now available on the [pyconau youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU/videos), including the two Friday mini conferences, Djangcon and OpenStack. They are being added to the [pyvideo](https://pyvideo.org/events/pycon-au-2013.html) site too:

* [PyCon AU 2013 videos](https://pyvideo.org/events/pycon-au-2013.html)
* [DjangoCon AU 2013 videos](https://pyvideo.org/events/djangocon-au-2013.html)
* [OpenStack miniconf AU 2013 videos](https://pyvideo.org/events/openstack-pycon-au-2013.html)

With the multiple streams of talks, there are lots that I missed and want to watch. Thanks to the organisers for arranging for the video and publishing them so quickly.

## Exploring Science on Twitter with IPython Notebook and Python Pandas

I gave a talk about the way I'm using python for my research. Looking up at the large auditorium before my talk was unsettling, but once I started I enjoyed it. I've put my slides and the ipython notebooks I used to generate them onto GitHub https://github.com/brendam/pyconau2013.

I had some interesting discussions with people afterwards. As I say at the beginning of the talk, I'm really happy to hear suggestions of how I can improve how I'm doing things, so please use the comments if you have any suggestions about my workflow or feedback about the talk.
