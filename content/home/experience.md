  description = """Founded The Reef Multimedia Pty Ltd with Kim Lynch and Jon Wright to explore the business opportunities of the rapidly expanding internet. The Reef Multimedia created the first corporate website in Australia for Norwich Union Financial Services Group. This was before Netscape and well before Microsoft Internet Explorer entered the picture. The site was made for the IBM web browser, OS/2 Explorer. It was claimed by Norwich to be the first corporate website in Australia. The Reef Multimedia became a successful web design company creating internet and intranet sites for a range of corporate, government and NGO clients including River Landscapes (LWA), WMC Resources, PRIA, Waterwatch and the Victorian Farmers Federation.

In 2000 the WMC website won the inaugural Investor Relations Award, an international award based on research by the investment research group, Assirt and sponsored by the UK Investor magazine. The Waterwatch Victoria website won the 1996 Australian Internet Awards in both the "Community and Special Interest" and "Secondary Education" categories. It was the only site which won in two categories. The Victorian Farmers Federation website was a finalist in the "Industry Sector" category.

The Reef operated as a virtual office with people working from different locations and communicating through the internet. The experience gained by doing this allowed The Reef to provide advice to clients on ways to efficiently manage remote working.
